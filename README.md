# factorio-mod-downloader

Factorio mod downloader, used [re146.dev](https://re146.dev/factorio/mods) to recursively download a mod and its all required depndedncies. Its really helpful if you want to download a modpack as a modpack contains various different recommended mods, that if you want to download separately will take you a lot of clicks and headache.

If you love the game please buy it and support the developers. I am a big fan of the game.

### How to run
1. Run the app, select the directory and add mod url from factorio portal i.e. URL for Krastorio 2 is: `https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2`.
2. Click on generate. The application will seem like its not responding. Don't panic, check the folder which you selected for downoading, the files are downloading, Once done, it will show a completed dialogue.

### Note
I have not included optional dependencies, as its a stupid idea, since a lots of mods, even they don't need something have optional dependencies mentioned. So it will probbaly take forever to finish downloading. It can be implemented although. Not a big task.

Also, download speed is based on re146, Its not super fast but its fine.

Feel free to reach out to me if you need some help.


### Todo:
Improve the spec file. I am not good with packaging. ðŸ¥¹
