Factorio mod downloader, uses [re146.dev](https://re146.dev/factorio/mods) to recursively download a mod and its all required depndedncies. Its really helpful if you want to download a modpack as a modpack contains various different recommended mods, that if you want to download separately will take you a lot of clicks and headache.

If you love the game please buy it and support the developers. I am a big fan of the game.

### Features
1. Added Dark Mode
2. Added progress bars and logs to see what files are being downloaded.
3. Completely interactive and requires no other dependency. 100% standalone app.


### How to download
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/vaibhavvikas/factorio-mod-downloader/releases)
2. Download the latest executable from the latest version added inside the assets dropdown. Latest release version is mentioned on the top of README.md file.


### How to run
1. Run the app, select the directory and add mod url from official factorio mod portal for e.g. URL for Krastorio 2 mod is: `https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2`.
2. Click on Download button.
3. The application will start downloading the mods and show the status and progress in the corresponding sections.
4. Once completed the application will show a download complete dialog.

### Note
I have not included optional dependencies, as its a stupid idea, since a lots of mods, even they don't need something have optional dependencies mentioned. So it will probably take forever to finish downloading. It can be implemented although. Not a big task.

Also, download speed is based on re146, Its not super fast but its fine.

Feel free to reach out to me or start a message in the discussions tab if you need some help.
